Na2C2O4,sodium oxalate,,ox,"js: does this contribute to the ""inorganic"" or the ""organic"" mole fraction contribution in a mole ratio?","ajn:  this contributes to the 'inorganic' component of the products, but should be considered it's own fraction in the mole ratio","js: OK, I will denote ""oxalate-like"" quantities with ""ox""",
S-3-apyr,(S)-3-aminopyrrolidine,,o,"js: (i) really? easy to add, but want to make sure this is true; (ii)   please let's not put parentheses in the abbreviation names because it screws up my scheme for storing the optimized geometries on disk; I changed the reaction chart to account for this","GMN: I didn't know what abbreviation to use, so I wrote it as this for now. The lab notebook is very clear that it does not have HCl, however.",ajn:  I removed the 'not HCl',
Na2TeO3,sodium tellurite,,i,,,,
"1,2-aepip",1-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine,,o,js: Is this the same as aep?  Need a IUPAC name,"GMN: jho244.4-6 have 1-aepip listed as the amine, but then there's a caret with a 2 in there. So 1,2-aepip?","ajn:  there is no 1,2-aep.  It's just aep.",js:  No problem.  We can have two sets of abbreviations for the same thing; I will just give it the same IUPAC name as aep
